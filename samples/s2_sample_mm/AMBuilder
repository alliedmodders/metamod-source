# which in the end would ruin the multi-platform (unix, win etc) loading by metamod as it won't be able to append platform specific extension
# so just fall back to the single binary.
# Multi-sdk solutions should be manually loaded with a custom plugin loader (examples being sourcemod, stripper:source)
