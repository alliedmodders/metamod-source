   trying to retrieve ISmmPluginManager.
 - Fixed bug where returning false in Load() after adding a Metamod event

   plugin.
 - Fixed bug where trying to load Metamod:Source a second time as a SourceMM or
   Valve server plugin could cause a crash.

   will now easily support new API releases without an SDK release, such as the
   case with Day of Defeat:Source.
 - Added more flexibility to plugin control by supplying an event system.
 - Removed dependency on libstdc++.so by supplying a small template library.
 - SourceHook internal API is now interface-based, meaning that future updates
   to the API will not break older plugins.  This update, however, breaks older
   plugins.
 - SourceHook is now re-entrant.
 - Added a basic automated installer (by Basic-Master).
 - Fixed a bug where games with changing game names would not work.
 - Fixed various bugs, including a cvarlist corruption bug on unloading plugins.

2005/07/07 1.00-RC2:

   is to fix the fact that Valve API provides no way to unlist a cvar/cmd.
 - Added two new commands - "meta cmds" and "meta cvars".
 - Added API calls for correctly printing to the console such that rcon will
   also receive messages that a plugin prints. This problem was mentioned on
   hlcoders and Valve offered no reply.
 - Added event hooking and cvar samples to sample_mm.
 - Added new cvar, mm_pluginsfile, which defaults to
   "addons/metamod/metaplugins.ini".
 - Fixed a bug where multiple vtable patches on the same hook were not
   re-patched when removed.  This caused a crash when two hooks were declared on
   one function, the first was removed, and the original function was then
   called.
 - Fixed "meta clear" not unloading all plugins.
 - Fixed Metamod:Source loading plugins with a higher current API version.
 - Fixed whitespace being parsed in metaplugins.ini.

   memory.
